# Manual Embedding Example
The embedding-files in this example were generated by opening the required files in a hex-editor (e.g. Okteta, HxD) and then copying the bytes as a C-Array.  

They were then pasted into the source code and the mime-type was then deduced by hand (compare line `4626` in `main.cpp` and following).
